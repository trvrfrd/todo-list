# todo-list
it's a todo list. i bet you've seen a million of them, but you haven't seen this
one, which is like the others, but worse!

see it live [here](http://trvrfrd.net/todo-list)

the list is stored in localStorage, so it might disappear if you clear your
cache or browsing data or what have you. also it might not work in Chrome if you
pull a local copy of the source and open index.html, maybe depending on your
security or privacy settings or something, or maybe just ever? idk ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
